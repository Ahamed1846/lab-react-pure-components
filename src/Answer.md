PureComponent is performing better because it implements a shallow comparison of states and only re-renders if there is any change in the state. If toggle is false and the counter button is clicked the state remains the same so it don't re-render again. But in case of SimpleCounterComponent does not implement any optimization logic and will re-render regardless of whether the states change or not.
